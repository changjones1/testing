		<h2>notes</h2>
		<p>this is running with no browserify and no node module everything is in main.js</p>
		<p>everything appears to work now</p>
		<p>made these changes in the github web ui bc not at home</p>
		<p>local copies on my machine will still be using "pages" branch with browserify(broken)</p>
		<p>need to fix later and get it to work with browserify</p>
		<p>the problem was the function called by the button onclick was never "defined" when using broswerify</p>
		<p>there was a console error each time</p>
		<p>another problem (solved) was using a form made the button do a submit which reloaded the page</p>
		<p>took out the form to fix that</p>
		<p>currently the "pages" branch is broken (with browserify).  the "pages1" branch is working (no browserify).</p>
		<p>change the live branch in github options to see the difference</p>
